// FIXME: Enhance erasure security with a more complex multi-pattern approach
// Consider implementing a 4-pass pattern with: 0x00, 0xFF, alternating 0xAA/0x55, and final 0x00
// This provides better protection against sophisticated memory forensics techniques
// Example implementation in secure_zero_raw_() function

// FIXME: Add memory allocation tracking system for comprehensive sensitive data protection
// Implement a thread_local registry to track sensitive allocations with automatic cleanup
// This would ensure sensitive data is erased even in exceptional situations
// Consider adding: register_sensitive_allocation() and cleanup_all_sensitive_allocations() methods

/**
 * @file security_ops.h
 * @brief Secure memory operations for sensitive data
 *
 * @section platform Platform Support
 * This module implements platform-specific memory erasure techniques:
 * - Windows: Uses SecureZeroMemory (untested)
 * - macOS/iOS: Uses memset_s (untested)
 * - Linux with glibc â‰¥2.25: Uses explicit_bzero
 * - Other platforms: Uses a multi-pass volatile memory overwrite with memory barriers
 *
 * @note The code for Windows and macOS is provided but has not been tested by the
 * developers. Community testing and feedback for these platforms is welcomed.
 *
 * @section security Security Considerations
 * While this library uses best practices for secure erasure, it cannot guarantee
 * complete protection against all types of memory analysis. Some factors beyond
 * the library's control include:
 *
 * - Hardware-level memory remanence (cold boot attacks)
 * - Memory compression by the operating system
 * - Memory swapped to disk before erasure
 * - Compiler optimizations that eliminate "unnecessary" memory operations
 *
 * The verification feature helps ensure the immediate effectiveness of the erasure
 * but cannot detect all possible issues.
